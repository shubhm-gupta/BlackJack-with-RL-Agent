    "## Review of the SARSA and Q-Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporal Difference(TD) Learning is a Model-Free environment that exploits the Markov Property i.e. the state transition model has Markov property when the future is dependent only on the current state not the past. TD considers that the agent knows only the partial information of the MDP. With only current and next state transition and without any model transition probability, TD lets the agent explore the environment to examine the random policy. We define a Q-function or Q-Table to evaluate the state and action altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use SARSA and Q-Learning to update the Q values. SARSA is an On-Policy method, which means it computes the Q-value according to a certain policy and then the agent follows that policy. Here is the formula that we use to update Q values in SARSA:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    Q(s_t, a_t) \\leftarrow Q(s_t, a_t) + \\alpha ( R_{t+1} + \\gamma Q(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}) - Q(s_t, a_t)) \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In Q-learning, we do not make assumption of behavior policy. Thus this is called as off-policy control. Q-learning is similar to SARSA except that when computing Q(s,a) it uses the greedy policy in determining the Q(s’,a’) from the next state s’. However, it does not necessarily follow that greedy policy. Here is the formula that we use to update Q values in Q-Learning:\n",

    "Out of the two TD Learning approaches, I will be using Q-Learning approach for my RL Agent for Blackjack. Both the aproaches are very much similar except for the difference that in SARSA we take actual action and in Q Learning we take the action with highest reward. For the Blackjack problem, our aim is to maximize the rewards, hence I am going the _greedy_ choice. Considering the action with maximum reward would make us reach the goal faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, without new data, greedy action selection will repeat the same actions, or repeatedly *exploit* the current knowledge. Thus, we need to *explore* other non-greedy actions to increase the experience to improve the Q estimation. This is called \"**_exploration-exploitation dilemma_**\". \n",

    "* Exploitation : is about exploiting the known information to maximize the reward.\n",

    "Due to exploration problem we don’t act greedily, instead, we use the $\\epsilon$-greedy action. With a parameter $\\epsilon \\in [0, 1]$, we can control the exploration and exploitation level. When $\\epsilon = 0$, the actions are selected in greedy manner, but when $\\epsilon = 1$, the actions are selected randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q-learning directly learns the optimal policy, whilst SARSA learns a near-optimal policy whilst exploring. If we want to learn an optimal policy using SARSA, then we will need to decide on a strategy to decay ϵ in ϵ-greedy action choice, which may become a complicated hyperparameter to tune. This is one of the other reason to choose Q-Learning over SARSA."

    "## Reading and Analysis of learning results and plots\n",

    "In this section, I will explain about the experiments that I ran to find out the best hyperparameters. i have used win percentage as my metric to decide for what value of hyperparameter, agent is performing best.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Learning Rate\n",
    "I tried various learning rates $\\alpha$ betweeen 0.001 to 1 and recorded the win percentage for each one of them. I got the best result for ** $\\alpha$  = 0.5 ** However, for other values win percentage was close by. So, we needed to tune other hyperparameters along with best value of $\\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Discount Factor & Epsilon\n",
    "Similarly for discount factor $\\gamma$  and $\\epsilon$, I tried values in range 0 to 1 and got the best results for $\\gamma$  = 0.1 When I increased the values, I saw the agent was not learning well enough and the win percentage was getting dropped. Hence, I decided for **$\\gamma$  = 0.1**\n",
    "The similar experiment when done with $\\epsilon$ provided best results for **$\\epsilon$ = 0.7** which is more toward the random action than a greedy choice of action in epsilon_greed fucntion\n",

    "##### Maxiter & Maxstep\n",
    "We ran all these experiments for the default value of 1000 iterations and 1000 steps which means 1000 games and 1000 rounds of training. I tried to play around with these number of iterations and found out that when we have more iterations, we get better results. Maybe, I would have got better results for more iterations, but due to computational complexities, I restricted my experimentation to 5K iterations. These are the best values that I got with these experiments :  \n",

    "##### ParameterGrid\n",
    "Once I got all the best hyperparamters after each individual experiment, I decided to combine these results and find out best hyperparameters when these are taken together. So achieve this, I used ParameterGrid from sklearn which creates a grid_list of all possible combinations. I used 10 different values of $\\alpha$ , 9 fifferent values of $\\gamma$ & $\\epsilon$ which resulted in (10*9*9) 810 different combinations. This was computationally challenging took almost an hour to run. Once it ran successfully, I got Best Parameters :  {'alpha': 0.8, 'epsilon': 0.7, 'gamma': 0.9} combination. For this experiment, I used default iterations and steps of 1000, else it would have been very time consuming.\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key highlights of my learning during this exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Blackjack is a card game where the goal is to obtain cards that sum to as near as possible to 21 without going over. They're playing against a fixed dealer. I had never played this game before though I usually play card games. I spent inital days in understanding this game and watched many Youtube videos to understand how betting is done and how a round/game is won. This is very interesting!  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this exercise, a learning agent successfully learned how to play blackjack and evaluate the win percentage(I used the number of rounds won the player over total rounds played in 1000 games). Q-learning was used by the agent to continuously update its Q-table during the learning process based on the action taken and the corresponding reward received. The rate at which the agent learns was proportional to the value of its learning rate, alpha which was initially set to 0.1. The agent first explored the environment rapidly by taking random decisions before relying on its Q-table to make appropriate decisions. This behavior was controlled by the agent's exploration factor, epsilon, which was initially set to 0.1   \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- I ran multiple experiments to find out best hyperparamters and it helped me understand how Q-Table is getting updated and how agent learns. However, testing with multiple parameters took a lot of time. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, it was very interesting to see a simple Q-Learning algorithm learn a satisfactory strategy to play blackjack."
